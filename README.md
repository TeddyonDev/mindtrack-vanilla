# MindTrack (Vanilla Version)

MindTrack is a personal project aimed at improving mental health and self-awareness through mood tracking and reminders. This version of the app is built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to focus on core web development skills.

## üöÄ Learning Journey

In this repository, you'll find various components and features built step-by-step as part of my learning journey through **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal was to understand how to structure code, manipulate the DOM, and work with event listeners, local storage, and dynamic content rendering.

## üì¶ Features and Components

Here are some key components I built during my learning process:

### 1. **Reminder Button**
   - A button that, when clicked, displays a random positive reminder to encourage users.
   - Built using vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling.

### 2. **Mood Tracker**
   - A form where users can input their mood and thoughts, which are then saved to **localStorage** for persistence.
   - The input data is validated, and a history of previous mood entries is displayed dynamically.

### 3. **Greeting Message**
   - A simple greeting feature that asks for the user's name and displays a personalized welcome message.
   - Includes input validation for the name field to ensure it's at least 3 characters long.

### 4. **Clear Button**
   - A button that clears the displayed content, including the greeting message or mood history.
   - Useful for resetting the interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page and components.
- **CSS**: For styling the app, with separate files for base styles, layout, and components.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interaction, including event listeners, DOM manipulation, and localStorage integration.
